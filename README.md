# Word-Guess-Game

This is a word guess game similar to hangman, with a theme based on the tv show, Rick and morty.

## Getting started

To get started go to  https://funkedee.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/.
Then press any key to start the game.  A series of _ will be displayed, each representing a letter of the word you are trying to guess.  Type a key to guess a letter.  Correct guesses will be displayed in their corresponding position in the word, while wrong guesses wwill be displayed in the "Letters already guessed" section.  For each wrong guess you will lose a "guesses left".  If you guess the word before running out of guesses, you win and the game will start over.  Your wins will be tallied in the "win" section. If your "Guesses left" reaches zero, you lose and the game wil start over.
